# Movie-Data-Analysis-using-Python

# Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a movie dataset (mymoviedb.csv) to uncover insights about movie genres, release trends, and popularity patterns.
It demonstrates key data analysis steps — from cleaning and transformation to visualization and insight extraction — using Python.

# Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas – data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

# Key Steps

Data Cleaning

Removed unnecessary columns (Overview, Original_Language, Poster_Url)

Converted Release_Date to datetime and extracted year

Handled missing values and duplicates

Split multi-valued Genre column and normalized the data

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution of genres

Year-wise release trends

Most and least popular movies

Genre frequency visualization

# Visual Insights

Genre Distribution:
Count plot showing which genres dominate the dataset.

Year-wise Movie Releases:
Histogram showing which years had the most film releases.

Popularity Extremes:
Identified movies with the highest and lowest popularity scores.

# Insights

“Drama” are among the most frequent genres.

The most popular movie in the dataset is Spider-Man.

Year 2020 had the highest number of film releases.

# Conclusion

This project highlights how Python can be used to analyze, visualize, and derive insights from raw movie data — a practical example of EDA for data analytics portfolios.
